# Midterm Project: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)



## Foreword

In this assignment, I will analyze data extracted from the "2024 Service Requests dataset", an intriguing set of information with plenty to uncover.

## 1. Introduction

## 2. Getting Data

Use two hashtag symbols (`##`) to create a level 2 heading like this one.

To include a screen capture, use the sample code below. Your images should be saved in the same folder as your `.md` file.

*Figure 1: The "Import file" prompt on Google Sheets.*

**Here are examples of functions and lines of code put in grey boxes:**

1. If you name a function, put it between "angled" quotation marks like this: `IMPORTHTML`.
1. If you want to include the entire line of code, do the same thing, albeit with your entire code: `=IMPORTHTML("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"; "table", 5)`.
1. Alternatively, you can put your code in an independent box using the template below:

``` r
=IMPORTHTML("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"; "table", 5)
```
This also shows how to create an ordered list. Simply put `1.` before each item.

## 3. Understanding Data

### 3.1. VIMO Analysis

Use three hashtag symbols (`###`) to create a level 3 heading like this one. Please follow this template when it comes to level 1 and level 2 headings. However, you can use level 3 headings as you see fit.
